Hi, I am Juliano Garcia, a Computer Scientist from IME-USP at the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br), and this is my personal blog. In 2019 I graduated in Computer Science with an specialization in *Artificial Intelligence*, focusing my studies in statistics, algorithms, machine learning and related areas in AI such as game theory, classical planning, knowledge-based systems, etc.

I currently work as a Data Scientist using state-of-the-art data science to empower people in their finantial lives at [Nubank's](https://nubank.com.br/en/) Credit/Lending team, in São Paulo/Brazil. My main areas of interest related to my work are AI and machine learning, the Python programming language, functional programming and statistics. To be more specific - Causal Inference, experimentation, pricing and risk modeling, and the development of machine learning models & systems within the Credit industry (covering valuation models, analytical frameworks, risk management, profitability analysis, etc).


In life, I'm deeply interested in the expressions of art, especially those which pushes existing boundaries and definitions to create new interpretations and experiences. Interested in modern cyberculture expressions and its branches (vaporwave and the whole 'aesthetic' categorization), visionary art, experimental and avant-garde productions in music. This blog is a place where I share my thoughts, ideas, etc. I update it rather sporadically, and the main purpose is mostly as a record for myself, but I hope you find something interesting here.
