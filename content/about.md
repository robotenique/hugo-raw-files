Hi, I am Juliano Garcia, a Computer Scientist from IME-USP at the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br), and this is my personal blog. In 2019 I graduated in Computer Science with an specialization in *Artificial Intelligence*, focusing my studies in statistics, algorithms, machine learning and related areas in AI such as game theory, classical planning, knowledge-based systems, etc.

I currently work as a Data Scientist using state-of-the-art data science to empower people in their finantial lives at [Nubank's](https://nubank.com.br/en/) Credit team, in São Paulo/Brazil.

My main areas of interest related to my work are AI and machine learning, the Python programming language, functional programming and statistics.
In life, I'm deeply interested in the expressions of art, especially those which pushes existing boundaries and definitions to create new interpretations and experiences. Interested in the ∆ ＶＡＰＯＲＷＡＶΞ ∆ aesthetic movement and related cyberculture expressions, visionary art, avant-garde productions in music and fashion. No, visual art didn't stop at the renaissance and good music didn't stop at the 80s: mind your [juvenoia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc) :D. Curious about psychology and neuroscience, the limits of human consciousness, perception and the fact that [*all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream*](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52829/a-dream-within-a-dream).
