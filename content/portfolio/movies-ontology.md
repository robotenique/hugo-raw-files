A knowledge-based systems is an area of study in artificial intelligence which tries to capture human knowledge (which usually are experts in the system) and embedded them into rules in a system. In this specific project iMDb data was used to create an ontology of movies, by parsing iMDb datasets and adding them into the ontology. The modelling of the ontology was made with Protégé, an open-source ontology editor, using a [Description Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic) called the **Web Ontology Language** (OWL).
