The purpose of this project is to study the Women's Shoes Prices dataset from **Kaggle**, which contains a list of women's shoes and the prices they were sold. The data was originally made available at Kaggle by the Datafiniti Company. This project was done mainly to showcase some basic EDA techniques (like histograms and ECDF) but at the same time diving deep into more complicated business questions, e.g. using [**Fuzzy matching**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) to find out the most popular shoe colors in the dataset.
