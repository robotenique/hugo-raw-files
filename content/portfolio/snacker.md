Snacker is a full-fledged social network for snack lovers all over the world. The website itself was built using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) library for the back-end, and the recommendation engine was implemented using a specific collaborative filtering technique called [**Matrix Factorization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)). The data was stored using MongoDB for prototyping and testing, more details about the methodology can be found [here](https://github.com/robotenique/snacker/blob/master/deliverables/doc/recommender.md).
